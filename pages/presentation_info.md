# Info for Presenters

From each accepted paper, one author is required to register and present at the conference. The conference registration form has a field where authors should enter the easychair IDs of those papers they will present.

The presentations will follow the usual format, i.e. there are 20 minute slots for long and 15 minute slots for short papers (including questions, so please prepare for a slightly shorter talk).

There will be a presentation laptop to show PDF and PowerPoint slides. There are two options to upload your slides to the presentation laptop:
1. You can bring a USB stick with your presentation
2. You can upload your presentation via an upload-only link that will be announced. In this case, your presentation file name should start with the prefix **SessionX_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME**, where **X** is the number of the session you are presenting in (refer to the [conference program](/pages/program), use **Session4** for the best paper session)
