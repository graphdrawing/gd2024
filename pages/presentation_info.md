## Speaker Information
The presentations will follow the usual format, i.e. there are 20 minute slots for long and 15 minute slots for short papers (including questions, so please prepare for a slightly shorter talk).

There will be a presentation laptop to show PDF and PowerPoint slides. There are two options to upload your slides to the presentation laptop:
1. You can bring a USB stick with your presentation
2. You can upload your presentation via an upload-only link that will be announced. In this case, your presentation file name should start with the prefix **SessionX_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME**, where **X** is the number of the session you are presenting in (refer to the [conference program](/pages/program), use **Session4** for the best paper session)

## Information for Poster Presenters
There will be a Fast Forward Teaser session preceding the poster and demo session on Wednesday, September 18.
For each presented poster and exhibited software, there will be the possibility to advertise the poster/software in one minute.

The one-minute teaser can be accompanied by a teaser slide, which has to be a one-page PDF and should be sent to <a href="mailto:gd2024@easychair.org">gd2024@easychair.org</a> no later than September 10.

Posters can be up to A0 (portrait) size. Please bring your posters on Wednesday, 18.09. and hang them up in the poster exhibition space in the back of the TUtheSky room before 14:00.

### Poster Printing
If you want to print your poster in Vienna, we recommend the express printing shop [Speedprint.wien](https://express-posterdruck.at) (Theobaldgasse 15, 1060 Vienna), which is just 500m from the venue. You can order online and jobs sent before 16:00 should be ready for pick-up the same day.
