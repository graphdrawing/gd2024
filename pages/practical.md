## Banks and currency Exchange
The currency in Austria is the Euro. Nearly every store, restaurant or attraction accepts credit card by now, but a few of the smaller stores or fast food/take-away places do only take cash. The easiest option to retrieve cash is to withdraw it from one of the many ATMs (Bankomat in German) around the city.

## Emergency phone numbers
Police, fire, ambulance (+43) 112

The main Hospital of Vienna is the AKH. Adress: Währinger Gürtel 18-20, 1090 Wien, Austria.

## Voltage
Electricity in Austria is 220V AC. Plugs are European standard with two round pins.

## Drinking water
Over 95% of tap water in Vienna originates in a mountain source in the Alps and is of highest quality. Water fountains across the city are labelled “Trinkwasser” (drinking water) to make it clear that you can use them too.

## Shopping
Be aware that on Sunday shops are closed, except for bakeries, souvenir shops and a few supermarkets at train stations.

## Dining out in Vienna and tipping
Most restaurants in Vienna are open from 11.30 until midnight. While service is included in the bill, some tipping is expected. A rough estimate is 5-10% rounded to a whole number. Typically the waiter tells you the amount of your bill (e.g. 11,90€) and you tell him/her what you want to pay (e.g. 13€). If you dine out in a group, you can ask the waiter that you want to split the bill.
