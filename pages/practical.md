## Dining Out and Tipping
Vienna offers an abundance of restaurants of all price ranges and both Austrian and international cuisines. In almost all places you can pay by card, but be aware that some smaller, traditional restaurants or snack stands might only accept cash. 
Splitting the bill, even of larger parties, is common&mdash;just tell your waiter.
Service is included in the price, yet a tip of 5--10% of the total amount is expected. 
Tipping is done by telling the waiter the total, rounded amount you wish to pay, e.g., for a bill of 18,50€ you might say 20€.

If you are looking for a place to have dinner, <em>Spittelberg</em> is a good location to look for.
It is a small part of Vienna next to <em>Museumsquartier</em> and close to the conference venue that is known for its small winding alleys, which houses many bars and restaurants.
Many restaurants have a small <em>Schanigarten</em> to eat outside if the weather permits.

For a drink afterwards, the area around <em>Museumsquartier</em> or the <em>Donaukanal</em> and the <em>Bermudadreieck</em> next to <em>Schwedenplatz</em> are known for their variety of different bars.

During PhD School, the booths at <em>Naschmarkt</em> are a good place to grab lunch within walking distance to the main venue.

Below you can find a (non-exhaustive) list of restaurants, bars, and ice cream places (all of them are also marked in the map) that are near the conference location.
A typical main dish in these restaurants costs usually between ten to fifteen euros (source: <a href="https://www.falter.at/lokalfuehrer" target="_blank">restaurant guide by Falter</a>).
All restaurants usually offer Vegeterian options and there are known for offering only Vegan options (highlithed below).

## Drinking Water
Tap water in Vienna is of very high quality and is transported to the city via aqueducts from alpine mountain springs more than 100km away. There is no need to buy bottled water, just use the  water bottle provided in your goodie bag and re-fill it in your hotel room, the conference venue, or one of the many public fountains (labeled <em>Trinkwasser</em>) found throughout the city.


## Emergencies
The international emergency phone number is <strong>112</strong> and can be called for free from any phone.
Pharmacies operate a 24-hour emergency service outside regular opening hours. Visit <a href="https://www.nachtapotheke.wien" target="_blank">www.nachtapotheke.wien</a> to find the one nearest to you. 


## Face Masks
Free FFP2 face masks are available at the registration desk.

## Public Transport
The local transport operator <em>Wiener Linien</em> offers subway (U-Bahn), tram, and bus services. Regular operating hours are from 5am to approximately midnight; outside these hours there is a network of night buses. On Friday and Saturday nights, subways run every 15 minutes during the whole night. 
Tickets need to be purchased in advance and must be validated before entering. The most convenient option for the whole GD week is the <em>7 Day Vienna</em> ticket. We recommend installing the <em>WienMobil</em> app on your phone, which allows you to do route planning and to buy electronic tickets.

## Banks and currency Exchange
The currency in Austria is the Euro. Nearly every store, restaurant or attraction accepts credit card by now, but a few of the smaller stores or fast food/take-away places do only take cash. The easiest option to retrieve cash is to withdraw it from one of the many ATMs (Bankomat in German) around the city.

## Emergency phone numbers
Police, fire, ambulance (+43) 112

The main Hospital of Vienna is the AKH. Adress: Währinger Gürtel 18-20, 1090 Wien, Austria.

## Voltage
Electricity in Austria is 220V AC. Plugs are European standard with two round pins.

## Drinking water
Over 95% of tap water in Vienna originates in a mountain source in the Alps and is of highest quality. Water fountains across the city are labelled “Trinkwasser” (drinking water) to make it clear that you can use them too.

## Shopping
Be aware that on Sunday shops are closed, except for bakeries, souvenir shops and a few supermarkets at train stations.

## Dining out in Vienna and tipping
Most restaurants in Vienna are open from 11.30 until midnight. While service is included in the bill, some tipping is expected. A rough estimate is 5-10% rounded to a whole number. Typically the waiter tells you the amount of your bill (e.g. 11,90€) and you tell him/her what you want to pay (e.g. 13€). If you dine out in a group, you can ask the waiter that you want to split the bill. -->
