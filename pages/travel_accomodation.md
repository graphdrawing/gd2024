## Travelling to Vienna

### by Train

In case you arrive to Vienna via train you will most likely exit at the new main train station just south of the city center. From there you can get into the local transportation system of the “Wiener Linien” (to subway (U-Bahn), tram (Straßenbahn), and local busses).

### by Plane

Vienna has an international airport (VIE) situated in the south of the city. Once you are there the easiest way to reach the city is to take a train from the airport train station. 

**Ground transportation from airport to city center**

See [here](https://shop.oebbtickets.at/en/ticket) for online train bookings from the airport to the city center.
All these options will lead you to a place where you can switch to the local transportation system of the "Wiener Linien" (to subway (U-Bahn), tram (Straßenbahn), and local busses).

- The train ÖBB-Railjet towards the main train station of Vienna (Wien Hauptbahnhof). It takes about 15 minutes and costs 4.40 Euro. It runs every half hour.
- Tram S7 towards Floridsdorf takes about 25 minutes to reach the station "Wien Mitte", where you can switch to the subway system and costs 4.40 Euro. It runs every half hour too. 
- The CAT train costs 14.9 Euro and runs to "Wien Mitte2 in about 16 minutes. 
- A Taxi for one person should costs you about 50 EUR for a drive from the airport to the city center.

### by Car

Vienna has a rather bad parking situation in the center. In case you are traveling by car we highly recommend to leave it in one of the “park+ride” P+R garages (an overview can be found [here](https://www.parken.at/page/7/park-&-ride-eine-idee-setzt-sich-durch) and [here](https://www.wien.info/en/travel-info/arrival-departure/park-ride-354906)). From there you can get into the local transportation system of the "Wiener Linien" (to subway (U-Bahn), tram (Straßenbahn), local bus (Bus)).

## Getting around in Vienna

**Public transport ‘‘Wiener Linien’’**

Vienna has great public transport. You may ride via

- Tram, in German called S-Bahn,
- Subway, in German called U-Bahn,
- Train,
- Bus,
- Bicycle.

The ["Wiener Linien"](https://www.wienerlinien.at/web/wl-en) tickets include the tram (S-Bahn), subway (U-Bahn), and buses inside the core zone (which you will only leave if you travel beyond the subway system).

**Plan with an App**

For planning your trips we recommend the iOS and Android app ["WienMobil"](https://www.wienerlinien.at/web/wl-en/wienmobil-features). Alternatively, Google maps has support for the Viennese transport system.

**Tickets**

Tickets can be bought in any subway station, inside the trams or with the bus driver. You can also buy tickets using the Wiener Linien app on iOS and Android.

Note: some tickets need to be validated when entering, the subway station, bus or tram.

Single tickets can be purchased at a price of EUR 2.40. A single ticket is valid for traveling one way in one zone. You may change to different lines in the course, but you may not interrupt your journey. The city of Vienna accounts for one full zone or core zone (Kernzone or "Zone 100").

**Recommendations**

We recommend to get a weekly ticket for 17.10 Euro. It is valid from Monday 9:00 AM to the following Monday 9:00 AM. It does not matter if you purchase it on any other day of the week, it will be valid from the last Monday before the day of purchase to the following Monday.

Another option is the 72 hour ticket which also costs 17.10 Euro, but is valid from the time of purchase until 72 hours later. There are 48 hours (14.10 Euro) and 24 hours (8.00 Euro) tickets too. For comparison a single, one-way trip costs 2.40 Euro.

**Bicycles**

After a free registration, you may rent a bike at various bicycle rental stations across the city. More information can be found [here](https://www.wien.info/en/lifestyle-scene/sports/cycling/bicycle-rentals-341248).

**Taxi**

If you need a ride you can either call a taxi or go to one of the many taxi stands all over Vienna.
