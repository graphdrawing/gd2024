## Access

The symposium takes place at Digital Multipurpose Hall, West bldg. 9, Ookayama Campus, Tokyo Institute of Technology.

### From Oimachi to Ookayama

The Oimachi Line takes you from Oimachi station (OI01) to Ookayama (OI08) in about ten minutes.  On a regular train Ookayama is the seventh stop, and on a rapid train the second.  Travel time difference between the two kinds of trains is small.

### From Gotanda to Ookayama

Take the Ikegami Line (a small train with only three cars) from Gotanda Station (IK01) to Hatanodai station (IK05/OM06), where you transfer to the Oimachi line, and get to Ookayama station (OM08/MG06).  Travel time from Gotanda to Hatanodai is five minutes, and from Hatanodai to Ookayama three minutes.  The main gate of the campus is conveniently located in front of Ookayama station.

### From the main gate to the symposium site (West Bldg. 9)

The main gate of the campus is conveniently located in front of the Ookayama station.  From the main gate of the university, take a right and walk down the winding road beside the seemingly unstable triangular building (the university library), and you will soon see West Building No. 9 on your left.  The Digital Multipurpose Hall is to the right of the entrance.
