## Access to the Venue

To access the location, enter the building BA (see <a href="https://tuw-maps.tuwien.ac.at?poi-id=14562" target="_blank">this interactive map</a> of the campus) and take the elevator to the 11th floor. The location is accessible by wheelchair.

The building BA can easily be reached from <em>Karlsplatz</em>.
<em>Karlsplatz</em> is a main hub in Viennas public transport system and as such served by the metro lines <span style="background-color: #e20210; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">U1</span> and <span style="background-color: #319f49; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">U4</span>.
Be aware that the metro line <span style="background-color: #935e98; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">U2</span> currently does not stop at <em>Karlsplatz</em>.
Furthermore, the tram lines <span style="background-color: #d3312c; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">D</span>, <span style="background-color: #d3312c; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">1</span>, <span style="background-color: #d3312c; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">2</span>, and <span style="background-color: #d3312c; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">71</span> stop at the station <em>Oper, Karlsplatz</em>, which is connected to <em>Karlsplatz</em> via an underground passage. 

Once at <em>Karlsplatz</em>, leave the station at the exit <em>Secession</em> and then head towards north-west. You reach the venue after five minutes.

If your hotel is located near <em>Mariahilfer Street</em>, you can reach the venue by heading towards <em>Platz der Menschenrechte</em> and then following the street <em>Getreidemarkt</em> for about five minutes in a south-easterly direction.
Alternatively, the bus line <span style="background-color: #1c60a7; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">57A</span> stops next to the venue (exit at <em>Getreidemarkt</em>) and connects the 6th and 15th district of Vienna with the venue.

If your hotel is located near <em>Westbahnhof</em>, you can reach the venue by first taking the <span style="background-color: #db7609; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">U3</span> until the station <em>Volkstheater</em>.
From there, it is a ten-minute walk in a south-easterly direction to the venue.
Alternatively, you can take the <span style="background-color: #db7609; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">U3</span> to <em>Stephansplatz</em> and change there to the <span style="background-color: #e20210; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">U1</span> which will take you to <em>Karlsplatz</em>.

A dedicated tram will take us from <em>Karlsplatz</em> along the famous <em>Ringstraße</em> and past many historical buildings to the <em>Prater</em>.
From there, it is a ten-minute walk to the restaurant.

If you do not want to join the tram ride, you can reach the social dinner either by taking the <span style="background-color: #935e98; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">U2</span> to <em>Krieau</em> or tram line <span style="background-color: #d3312c; color: white; font-weight: bold; padding: 0px 2px;">1</span> to <em>Prater, Hauptallee</em>.
In both cases, it is only a ten-minute walk to the social dinner.
