## Full Papers

We invite authors to submit papers describing original research of theoretical or practical significance to graph drawing and network visualization. To promote a balanced coverage of the field, GD has two distinct tracks, and papers submitted to one track will not compete with papers submitted to the other track. Regular papers must be submitted explicitly to one of the two tracks. However, all program committee members may review papers from either track.

### Track 1: Combinatorial and algorithmic aspects

This track is mainly devoted to **fundamental graph drawing advances**, such as combinatorial aspects and algorithm design.  The range of topics for this track includes (but is not limited to):

* Design and analysis of graph drawing algorithms
* Geometric and topological graph theory
* Computational topology of graphs on surfaces
* Geometric network design and optimization
* Geometric computing

### Track 2: Experimental, applied, and network visualization aspects

This track is mainly devoted to the **practical aspects of graph drawing**, such as the development and evaluation of network visualization algorithms, systems, and interfaces in different application areas.  The range of topics for this track includes (but is not limited to):

* Visualization of networks in real world applications
* Engineering of graph drawing algorithms and network visualization systems
* Benchmarks and experimental studies of algorithms, systems, and user interfaces for graph drawing and network visualization
* Cognitive studies on network visualization readability and user interaction
* Interfaces and methods for interacting with graphs and networks

Authors of accepted applied papers can request the opportunity to show a demo of their software/system during the poster session.

## Short Papers

In addition to the above two tracks, there will be a separate category for short papers, describing theoretical or applied contributions of shorter length. Papers in this category will be assigned a shorter time for presentation during the conference.

## Submission Format

All submissions must be formatted using the appropriate LaTeX style file, either [gd-llncs.cls](../../assets/template/gd-llncs.cls) for long papers or [gd-llncs-short.cls](../../assets/template/gd-llncs-short.cls) for short papers; these are derived from the style file used for the conference series Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) provided by Springer.  The default margins and fonts must not be modified; in particular, the use of packages such as times.sty is not allowed. Submissions that do not comply with this format risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

<!-- To promote inclusion of figures in the submitted papers, submissions will have a strict number of lines limit. Regular papers must have at most 400 lines, (excluding references and figures) and at most 14 pages (excluding references). Short papers must have at most 225 lines (excluding references and figures) and at most 7 pages (excluding references). The claims of the paper should be fully substantiated. If this information does not fit within the page limits, the authors should include it in a clearly marked appendix, whose length is not constrained and which the reviewers may read at their own discretion.  All submissions will be handled through EasyChair at the web site [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gd2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gd2022) -->

To promote inclusion of figures in the submitted papers, submissions will have a strict number of lines limit. Regular papers must have at most 400 lines and at most 14 pages (excluding references). Short papers must have at most 225 lines and at most 7 pages (excluding references).
When counting the lines, the following sections should be excluded: title, authors block, keywords, and references. For figures, tables, and algorithm pseudo-code, only the lines of the main caption should be counted. Lines in all the rest of the paper should be counted, including the abstract.
The claims of the paper should be fully substantiated. If this information does not fit within the line/page limits, the authors should include it in a clearly marked appendix, whose length is not constrained and which the reviewers may read at their own discretion. All submissions will be handled through EasyChair at the web site [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gd2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gd2022)

## Posters

Submissions of posters on graph drawing, network visualization, and related areas are solicited.  The poster session will provide a forum for the communication of late-breaking research results (which may also appear elsewhere) to the GD community. Authors of posters should prepare an abstract (up to 2 pages in the LNCS style) that must be submitted together with the poster itself.

## Lightweight Double-Blind Review Process

This year, for the first time in the GD conference, the review process will be handled in a “lightweight double-blind mode”. This means that authors are not allowed to reveal their identity in the paper that they submit to GD’22, but are free to disseminate draft versions of the paper prior to the conference and to give talks on the topic as they normally would. In particular, the submitted paper should not contain authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses. References to their own related work are allowed, as long as the supporting text maintains anonymity (e.g., using sentences in the third person, anonymising references).
Members of the Program Committee will not have the identity of the authors of any paper revealed to them during the entire review process. To handle conflicts of interest effectively, authors will be offered the opportunity to declare conflict of interest with relevant PC members when they submit their paper.

## Publication: Proceedings and Special Issues

All accepted papers (including the two-page poster abstracts) will appear in the conference proceedings, published by **Springer** in the **Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)** series. The LNCS proceedings will be made freely accessible to the GD community upon publication and openly accessible to anyone after four years.
Authors will be required to submit their accepted papers to the **arXiv repository** at the same time as submitting their camera-ready versions, in order to provide immediate and unrestricted open access to them. The self-archived arXiv papers shall consist of the LNCS proceedings version (identical, except for possibly changed references to the appendix resp. the arXiv version) plus an optional clearly marked appendix. This appendix could contain a long version of the entire paper or proofs that have been omitted from the main text. Subsequent submissions of revised versions of the paper to the arXiv (known as arXiv “replacements’’) are allowed. Upon submission of the camera-ready version of an accepted paper, the authors will be required to specify the arXiv identifier associated with the paper for inclusion in a **conference index**, which will be also published in the arXiv repository. Failure to comply with these guidelines will impede the publication of the paper.
Each paper or poster must be presented at the conference by an author (barring unforeseen circumstances), otherwise the paper will not be included in the proceedings. Should any visa/travel restriction prevent an author from attending the conference and presenting a paper, he/she will be given ways to participate and give the talk via electronic means.

Selected papers from both tracks will be invited for submission to a special issue of the **Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications (JGAA)**. The authors of two selected papers in Track 2 will be invited to submit a substantially extended and enhanced version of their work to **IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)**.
A TVCG papers session at the Graph Drawing conference will also feature regular TVCG papers. Please find more details at [https://www.computer.org/digital-library/journals/tvcg/tvcg-partners-with-conferences](https://www.computer.org/digital-library/journals/tvcg/tvcg-partners-with-conferences)

## Award

For each of the two tracks, the Program Committee of GD 2022 will bestow a **Best Paper Award**. In addition, to recognize the effort of participants to present their work and to prepare their posters in a clear and elegant way, there will be a **Best Presentation Award** and a **Best Poster Award** voted on by the GD 2022 attendees.
