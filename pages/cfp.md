## Call for Papers

[Download the call for papers as PDF](https://graphdrawing.github.io/gd2024/assets/pdfs/Call_for_Papers-2024.pdf)

**Graph Drawing** is concerned with the geometric representation of graphs and constitutes the algorithmic core of **Network Visualization**. Graph Drawing and Network Visualization are motivated by applications where it is crucial to visually analyze
and interact with relational datasets. Examples of such application areas include data science, social sciences, web computing, information systems, life sciences, geography, business intelligence, information security, and software engineering.

GD has been the main annual event in this area for more than 30 years. Its focus is on combinatorial and algorithmic aspects
of graph drawing, their practical evaluation, as well as the design of network visualization systems and interfaces.
Researchers and practitioners working on any aspects of graph drawing and network visualization are invited to contribute
papers and posters and to participate in the symposium as well as the graph drawing contest.

GD 2024 will be held in Vienna, Austria, on September 18-20, 2024 with a reception on the evening of September 17. A preconference PhD school will take place September 16-17, 2024. GD 2024 is designed to be held on-site. It is expected that
regular papers are presented on site by one of the authors. To address the global challenges and as an offer for authors who
are unable to attend we allow for a limited number of remote presentations in the form of preproduced videos.

The code of conduct for the GD conference can be found at [http://graphdrawing.org/codeOfConduct.html](http://graphdrawing.org/codeOfConduct.html)

## Papers

We invite authors to submit papers describing original research of theoretical or practical significance to graph drawing and
network visualization. To promote a balanced coverage of the field, GD has two distinct tracks, and papers submitted to one
track will not compete with papers submitted to the other track. Regular papers must be submitted explicitly to one of the
two tracks. However, all program committee members may review papers from either track.

### Track 1: Combinatorial and algorithmic aspects

This track is mainly devoted to **fundamental theoretical graph drawing advances**, such as combinatorial aspects and
algorithm design. The range of topics for this track includes (but is not limited to):

* Design and analysis of graph drawing algorithms
* Geometric and topological graph theory
* Computational topology of graphs on surfaces
* Graph representations
* Geometric algorithms and optimization

### Track 2: Experimental, applied, and network visualization aspects

This track is mainly devoted to the **practical aspects of graph drawing**, such as experimental evaluations of graph drawing
related algorithms, the development and/or evaluation of related libraries and tools, or systems and interfaces in different
application areas. The range of topics for this track includes (but is not limited to):

* Engineering of graph drawing algorithms and network visualization systems
* Interfaces, methods, and high-quality tools for interacting with graphs and networks
* Benchmarks and experimental studies in the context of graph drawing and network visualization
* Cognitive studies on network visualization readability and user interaction
* Visualization of networks in real world applications

Authors of accepted applied papers are encouraged to show a demo of their software/system during the poster session.

### Short Papers

In addition to the above two tracks, there will be a separate category for short papers. Here we welcome smaller and less
elaborate contributions on relevant topics. Papers in this category will be assigned a shorter time for presentation during the conference.

### Remote Presentation

For authors who cannot present their paper in person we offer the possibility for remote presentation. Authors of accepted
papers in this category have to register for the conference. Papers in this category are evaluated and selected by the program
committee by applying the same high standards as for the other tracks. In addition the authors have to submit a recording of
their presentation two weeks after the submission of the paper. The remote submission chair can influence the score of
papers in this track based on the quality of the recording and even reject submissions if the quality of the recording is
inappropriate. There is a limit of six remote presentations.

### Rules for Submission

Results that have been previously published (or are scheduled for publication) in another conference proceedings or journal,
as well as simultaneous submissions of results to other conferences with published proceedings or journals are not
permitted. Each paper or poster must be presented at the conference by an author, otherwise the paper can be excluded from
publication in the proceedings.

ChatGPT and similar large language models may be used to improve the paper’s language, but its use should be mentioned as
a footnote and the authors remain responsible for the full paper. In particular, the unattributed use of any such tools in the creation of the paper’s scientific content is forbidden.

### Submission Format

Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the [LIPIcs proceedings guidelines](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/series/LIPIcs#author). Authors must use the LaTeX class file
[GD-lipics-v1.cls](../../assets/template/GD-lipics-v1.cls), which is a wrapper around the standard LIPIcs class. Submissions must not exceed 500 lines, (225 lines for short contributions) excluding front matter (title, authors, and affiliations), references, and a clearly marked appendix. The class files provide line counting which should be accurate in most cases. Authors should avoid substantial amounts of text in unnumbered lines.
To promote inclusion of figures in the submitted papers, submissions will have a strict limit on the number of text lines.
Regular papers may have at most 500 lines, short papers 225 lines. We expect the main content of the paper to typically fit
within 12 pages excluding references. For publishing purposes, the average length of final versions is limited to 20 pages
(including everything). The claims of the paper should be fully substantiated. If this information does not fit within the line
limit, the authors should include it in a clearly marked appendix, whose length is not constrained and which the reviewers
may read at their own discretion.

## Posters & Contest

Submissions of posters on graph drawing, network visualization, and related areas are solicited. The poster session will
provide a forum for the communication of late-breaking research results (which may also appear elsewhere) to the GD
community. Authors of posters should prepare an abstract (up to 2 pages in LIPIcs style) that must be submitted together
with the poster itself.
Details about the traditional **Graph Drawing Contest**, which is held at the conference, are provided at the [website](https://www.graphdrawing.org/gdcontest/contest2024).

## Lightweight Double-Blind Review Process

The review process will be handled in a **lightweight double-blind mode**. This means that authors are not allowed to
reveal their identity in the submitted paper, but are free to disseminate draft versions of the paper prior to the conference
and to give talks on the topic as they normally would. In particular, the submitted paper should not contain the authors'
names, affiliations, and email addresses. References to their own related work are allowed, as long as the supporting text
maintains anonymity (e.g., using sentences in the third person).
Members of the Program Committee will not have the identity of the authors of any paper revealed to them during the entire
review process. To handle conflicts of interest effectively, authors will be offered the opportunity to declare conflicts of
interest with PC members when they submit their paper.

## Paper Submission, Proceedings and Special Issues

Papers should be submitted electronically via **EasyChair** at the website [to be announced soon].<!--[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gd2024](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gd2024).-->
The proceedings will be published in the **Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs)** series and are available
open access.
Selected papers from both tracks will be invited for submission to a special issue of the **Journal of Graph Algorithms and
Applications (JGAA)**. The authors of two selected papers in Track 2 will be invited to submit a substantially extended and
enhanced version of their work to **IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)**. A special TVCG
papers session at the Graph Drawing conference will also feature regular TVCG papers. Further details can be found at
[https://www.computer.org/digital-library/journals/tvcg/tvcg-partners-with-conferences](https://www.computer.org/digital-library/journals/tvcg/tvcg-partners-with-conferences)

## Awards

For each of the two tracks, the Program Committee of GD 2024 will bestow a **Best Paper Award**. In addition, to recognize the
effort of participants to present their work and to prepare their posters in a clear and elegant way, there will be a **Best Presentation Award** and a **Best Poster Award** voted on by the GD 2024 attendees.
