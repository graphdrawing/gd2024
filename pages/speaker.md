<p> <strong> Title: </strong> </p>
<p> How Can Biclique Covers Help in Matching Problems </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p> In several settings one encounters assignment or matching problems
between objects of two different types, and needs to run a computation
on a bipartite graph.  While this graph can potentially be dense, it
can sometimes be represented compactly using a biclique cover.  This
is in particular often the case when the objects are geometric - we
will look at examples, and see how recent progress on maximum flow can
be combined with such biclique covers to obtain faster algorithms. </p>

<p> <strong> Title: </strong> </p>
<p> How Can Algorithms Help in Protecting our Privacy </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p> Decisions are increasingly automated using rules that were learnt from personal data. Thus, it is important to guarantee that the privacy of the data is protected during the learning process. To formalize the notion of an algorithm that protects the privacy of its data, differential privacy was introduced by Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, and Smith in 2006. It is a rigorous mathematical definition to analyze the privacy properties of an algorithm – or the lack thereof. In this talk I will give an introduction to differential privacy with an emphasis on differential private algorithms that can handle dynamically changing input data. </p>

He received a BSc and an MSc from Tokyo University of Science in 1984 and 1986. He received a Ph.D. in engineering from the University of Tokyo in 1997. He joined Fujitsu Limited in 1986. He worked at the International Institute for Advanced Study of Social Information Sciences, where he worked with Kozo Sugiyama and others on the research and development of graph drawing and idea support tools. In 2004, he moved to the University of Tsukuba. He has been involved in the development of visualization methods not only for graph drawing but also for various types of data. In 2021, he published "Introduction to Information Visualization (Japanese)," which organized the knowledge he had collected so far. </p>
