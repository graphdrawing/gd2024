He received a BSc and an MSc from Tokyo University of Science in 1984 and 1986. He received a Ph.D. in engineering from the University of Tokyo in 1997. He joined Fujitsu Limited in 1986. He worked at the International Institute for Advanced Study of Social Information Sciences, where he worked with Kozo Sugiyama and others on the research and development of graph drawing and idea support tools. In 2004, he moved to the University of Tsukuba. He has been involved in the development of visualization methods not only for graph drawing but also for various types of data. In 2021, he published "Introduction to Information Visualization (Japanese)," which organized the knowledge he had collected so far. </p>
