<p> <strong> Title: </strong> </p>
<p> How Can Biclique Covers Help in Matching Problems </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p> In several settings one encounters assignment or matching problems
between objects of two different types, and needs to run a computation
on a bipartite graph.  While this graph can potentially be dense, it
can sometimes be represented compactly using a biclique cover.  This
is in particular often the case when the objects are geometric - we
will look at examples, and see how recent progress on maximum flow can
be combined with such biclique covers to obtain faster algorithms. </p>

<p> <strong> Biography: </strong> </p>
<p> Otfried Cheong received his Ph.D. in mathematics from FU Berlin, and
has held academic positions at Utrecht University, Postech, Hong Kong
University of Science & Technology, TU Eindhoven, and KAIST.  He now
works for SCALGO, designing and implementing algorithms for water flow
simulations.  He is the author of the vector graphics editor 'Ipe',
and one of the authors of a well-known text book on computational
geometry. </p>

<p> <strong> Title: </strong> </p>
<p> How Can Algorithms Help in Protecting our Privacy </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p> Decisions are increasingly automated using rules that were learnt from personal data. Thus, it is important to guarantee that the privacy of the data is protected during the learning process. To formalize the notion of an algorithm that protects the privacy of its data, differential privacy was introduced by Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, and Smith in 2006. It is a rigorous mathematical definition to analyze the privacy properties of an algorithm â€“ or the lack thereof. In this talk I will give an introduction to differential privacy with an emphasis on differential private algorithms that can handle dynamically changing input data. </p>
