# Keynote Speakers

## Ulrik Brandes (ETH Zürich, Switzerland)

<p> <strong> Title: </strong> </p>
<p> Positions in Social and Other Spaces </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p>
Social networks are a traditional source of inspiration for graph drawing methods, and their analysis continues to motivate a variety of layout constraints and objectives.
</p>
<p>
In recent years, my research has increasingly been focused on methodological questions related to social networks and other applied areas of network science. This has led to a framework, dubbed the positional approach, which facilitates adaptive and theory-informed empirical network data science. It turns out, however, that it is also another rich source of algorithmic and visualization problems. The present contribution is therefore forward-looking, using results from the past few years to point out possible directions for future research in three parts.
</p>
<p>
In the first part, I review some defining aspects of the positional approach to network science with an eye towards challenges for graph drawing and network visualization. These are centered largely on combinatorial problems involving preorders and graph classes.
</p>
<p>
A particularly strong link between influence processes on social networks and barycentric graph drawing is discussed in the second part. Using concepts from above, this extends naturally to calls for novel scaling methods and research on graph embeddings.
</p>
<p>
The final part is about collectice behavior in the context of team sports. More precisely, I will outline problems arising from our most recent efforts of performance analysis in association football (soccer) using proximity graphs.

Ulrik Brandes is professor for social networks at ETH Zürich. His background is in computer science; he obtained a Diploma degree from RWTH Aachen and a doctoral degree from the University of Konstanz with a dissertation on graph drawing. After his habilitation in 2002 he became associate professor at the University of Passau in the same year, and professor for algorithmics at the University of Konstanz one year later. He is vice-president of the International Network for Social Network Analysis (INSNA), coordinating editor of Network Science, and on the editorial boards of Social Networks, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications, and Computer Science Review. From 2007-2014 he served on the Graph Drawing Steering Committee.
<br/>
His main interests are in network analysis and visualization, with application to social networks in particular. He is a co-author of the visone software for network analysis and the GraphML data format. Following a DFG-funded Reinhart Koselleck-Project (2011-2017) on Social Network Algorithmics, he takes a shot at improving the methodological foundations of network science. As a principal investigator in the ERC Synergy Project NEXUS 1492 (2013-2019) he worked on reconstructing archaeological networks from fragmented and heterogeneous observations. Currently, he is devoting more time to network representations in sports analytics.

## Kazuo Misue‬ (University of Tsukuba, Japan)

<p> <strong> Title: </strong> </p>
<p> Graph Drawing for Thinking Support </p>
<p> <strong> Abstract: </strong> </p>
<p> In human intellectual activities, organizing the objects of thought is an important task. When the object of thought is large or complex, it is difficult for many people to organize it in their minds. In such cases, it is effective to take these objects out of our minds and observe them externally. When we externalize our thoughts in this way, the form of representation of the objects also influences the effectiveness and efficiency of our thinking process. When we organize fragments of information, we often establish a relationship between two fragments and group several fragments together. In the case of externalization, these relationships and groups are represented graphically, that is, the words and figures representing the fragments are connected by line segments or surrounded by closed lines. Some of the so-called "ideation techniques" systematize such diagramming methods. The "KJ method" is one such technique.
</p>

<p> In the diagram used in the KJ method, if each fragment of information is represented by a node, links connecting two nodes and closed curves surrounding the nodes are used. Moreover, in the KJ method, we can organize objects of thought by transforming a compound diagram that comprises a node-link diagram and an Euler diagram. The original KJ method was designed to be performed entirely by hand using analog tools such as cards, pens, and cords, and it was not intended for the use with computers. This, however, is also a factor that discourages the active use of the KJ method, although its usefulness as an ideation technique has been recognized. For example, despite the effectiveness of repeated drawing of diagrams on the same topic, we often do so only once because repeating the process requires time and effort.
</p>

<p> The transformation operation of a compound diagram can be viewed as the transformation operation of a compound graph; to obtain a visual representation of such a compound graph, automatic drawing techniques are required. If we can separate the transforming operations of a compound diagram from the thinking process and if the transforming operations can be supported by a computer, the hurdles associated with the use of such an ideation technique will be reduced, and the efficiency of the ideation process could increase. Eventually, this increased efficiency will lead to an improvement in the quality of the ideation process and its products.
</p>

<p> This talk introduces the research and development that has been carried out with this motivation.

He received a BSc and an MSc from Tokyo University of Science in 1984 and 1986. He received a Ph.D. in engineering from the University of Tokyo in 1997. He joined Fujitsu Limited in 1986. He worked at the International Institute for Advanced Study of Social Information Sciences, where he worked with Kozo Sugiyama and others on the research and development of graph drawing and idea support tools. In 2004, he moved to the University of Tsukuba. He has been involved in the development of visualization methods not only for graph drawing but also for various types of data. In 2021, he published "Introduction to Information Visualization (Japanese)," which organized the knowledge he had collected so far. </p>
